# wonder 

wonder is intended to increase your desire to see the world around you.

### How to run

1. Clone this repo.
1. Run `make build-prod serve`. This builds the wasm output and then serves the minimal html locally.
1. Go to [http://localhost:3434/](http://localhost:3434/).
1. This will ask for access to your webcam. Now you can change the radio buttons to modify the color of the video.
   - Additionally, there's currently an option to "upload an image" which will apply the effect once to that image.

#### Many thanks to the internet

This work started as a copy of github.com/agnivade/shimmer, and then I mixed it with the tutorial [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_manipulation) to learn about webcam interaction.
