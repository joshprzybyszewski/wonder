# wonder 

wonder is intended to increase your desire to see the world around you.

### Setup

This work started as a copy of github.com/agnivade/shimmer.

- Run `make build-prod`
- Run `go run scripts/server.go`. (Originally: Serve the files using any HTTP server. (Note that .wasm files need to be served with `application/wasm` mime type. So the server must be capable of doing that.))
